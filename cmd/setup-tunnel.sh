# Common Compute OS - Cloudflare Tunnel Setup
# This script installs and configures cloudflared to create a persistent,
# secure tunnel from a public URL to the local Ollama proxy.

# --- Prerequisites ---
# 1. A Cloudflare account.
# 2. A domain name added to your Cloudflare account.

# --- Helper Functions ---
